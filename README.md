Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered system that creates personalized nutrition plans for individuals with diabetes. The system will take into account various health-related factors such as medical analyses, weight, dietary habits, calorie consumption, and more. Additionally, it will consider socioeconomic factors such as income, location, education, and literacy levels to ensure that the plan is accessible and effective for a wide range of users, particularly those in rural or underserved communities. For individuals with limited literacy, the nutrition plan will include visual representations to improve comprehension and adherence.
